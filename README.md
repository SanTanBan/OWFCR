Off-Shore Wind Farm Cable Routing Problem

The first formulation is codified in Gurobi.
The Inputs are given through the Input.xlsx file and C value (maximum number of entering cables allowed into a SubStation) is set manually in the code.
The improved no-cross constraint (Equation 14) is not used and instead the Equation 10 is retained.

The Outputs are obtained in the same folder in Excel and PNG/JPG/PDF/EPS formats.
